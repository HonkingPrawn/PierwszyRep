Photoshop 1.0 was the first ever version of Adobe Photoshop to be created. 
Originally a simple program (named Display) created to display grayscale graphics, 
John Knoll influenced his brother, Thomas Knoll, to turn Display into a full image editing application which they named Photoshop. 
Development on Photoshop 1.0 began in 1987 and was released by Adobe in 1990 for Macintosh systems. 
The program was used to edit and manipulate images that had been digitally transferred onto a computer via a scanner.
